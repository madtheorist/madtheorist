## üëã Hi there! I'm Jesse :)

üíº I'm a data science consultant at Deloitte UK. Prior to this, I studied for an integrated master's degree in physics at Oxford University, graduating with first class honours in 2023.

üë®‚Äçüíª Over the last couple of years, I've been developing route optimisation software for a large telco client. My work mainly consists of writing code in Python and SQL to turn the client's infrastructure and costing data into a weighted graph, applying a shortest-path algorithm to determine optimal fibre routes. I've learned a lot about network analysis, geospatial analytics, and clustering.

üìä I've enjoyed the challenge of navigating a large object-oriented codebase and have gained exposure to cloud computing (AWS), CI/CD (Git, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform), unit testing, data pipelining (Airflow), and data visualisation (Streamlit). My role also involves presenting the business impact of technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders.
