## üëã Hi there! I'm Jesse :)

üíº I'm a data science consultant at Deloitte UK. Prior to this, I studied for an integrated master's degree in physics at Oxford University, graduating with first class honours in 2023.

üë®‚Äçüíª Over the last couple of years, I've been developing route optimisation software for a large telco client. My work mainly consists of writing code in Python and SQL to turn the client's infrastructure and costing data into a weighted graph, applying a shortest-path algorithm to determine optimal fibre routes. In the process, I've learned a lot about network analysis, geospatial analytics, and clustering.

üìä I've enjoyed the challenge of navigating a large object-oriented codebase and have gained exposure to cloud computing (AWS), CI/CD (Git, Docker, Jenkins, Terraform), unit testing, data pipelining (Airflow), and data visualisation (Streamlit). My role also involves presenting the business impact of technical solutions to non-technical stakeholders. 

üìà **Recent projects**:

- [Credit fraud transaction API](https://github.com/madtheorist/credit-fraud-api): I created an API endpoint that serves predictions on whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not given small set of input features. I did this primarily to refresh my knowledge of classifiers, and to learn more about preparing a machine learning model for deployment using Docker and FastAPI.
- [Quark engine](https://github.com/madtheorist/quark): a simple chess engine that I built to learn about search trees and object-oriented design patterns.
- [Predicting rainfall patterns using sea surface temperature data](https://github.com/madtheorist/mphys): My master's project on predicting rainfall patterns using global sea surface temperature data, leveraging linear regression and CNNs.
- [Battery lifetime estimation](https://github.com/natskiu/Nasa-Battery): A summer internship project that I completedin 2021 at the University of Hong Kong focused on using machine learning to estimate lithium ion battery lifetimes. I worked on this in conjunction with another intern, Venus Lee. This was my first foray into data science.
